Changed: The deprecated function FEValuesBase::get_normal_vectors()
that returned a vector of Point objects has been removed. Its
replacement, FEValuesBase::get_all_normal_vectors() has now itself
been deprecated, and we have created a new function 
FEValuesBase::get_normal_vectors() that returns a vector of
Tensor<1,dim> objects. The net effect is that the function with the
old name has simply gotten a new return type.
