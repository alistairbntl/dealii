Changed: The member function Boundary::project_to_surface is now ignored in the
function GridTools::fix_up_distorted_child_cells. Instead,
GridTools::fix_up_distorted_child_cells uses an internal function that
duplicates the algorithm used by StraightBoundary::project_to_surface, which was
the only place project_to_surface was implemented in the library.
