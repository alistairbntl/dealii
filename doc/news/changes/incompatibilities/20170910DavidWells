Changed: The methods
<ol>
  <li>Manifold::get_new_point</li>
  <li>Manifold::project_to_manifold</li>
</ol>
have had their declarations changed in an incompatible manner: these three
methods now take ArrayView arguments instead of <code>std::vector</code>s. This
change was done for performance reasons: before this change about a third of the
time spent generating a curved grid (in this particular benchmark, a circle
described with polar coordinates and a transfinite interpolation) was used in
allocating and freeing memory used by the <code>std::vector</code> arguments to
Manifold::get_new_point() even though the sizes of the arrays are usually known
at compilation time. This change completely eliminates this allocation cost.

The method <code>Manifold::add_new_points()</code> has been removed in favor of
Manifold::get_new_points(), which also uses ArrayView arguments instead of
<code>std::vector</code>s.
