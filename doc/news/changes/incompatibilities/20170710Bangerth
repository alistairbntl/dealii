Changed: The TableIndices class had a single constructor that just
took as many indices as one wanted, and padded any unassigned indices
with numbers::invalid_unsigned_int. This invited mistakes and indeed
led to difficult to track down errors.
<br>
This constructor is therefore now deprecated, and has been replaced by
a series of constructors with between one and five arguments that can
be used for objects of type TableIndices<1> to TableIndices<5>.
