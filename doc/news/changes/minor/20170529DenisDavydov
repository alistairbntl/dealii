New: deal.IIFeatureConfig.cmake will contain detailed information about
feature configuration and is installed along with other CMake files.
These variables can be loaded by calling INCLUDE(\${DEAL_II_FEATURE_CONFIG}).
This is useful when users want to link in additional parts of dependencies, not
required by deal.II (i.e. filesystem library from Boost package).
