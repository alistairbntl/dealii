Fixed: It turns out that it was not possible to copy an invalid
operator, i.e., the following code would yield an exception:
@code
  typename DoFHandler<dim>::active_cell_iterator invalid_1;
  typename DoFHandler<dim>::active_cell_iterator invalid_2;

  invalid_1 = invalid_2;  // resulted in an error
@endcode
This made no sense, and has now been fixed.
