Fixed: The destructor of TimerOutput::Scope will now always exit the subsection
it entered in its constructor, instead of just exiting the last subsection that
was created in the provided TimerOutput object. This fixes timing output
measurements for multithreaded applications and cases where subsections are
nested.
