New: All of the FEValuesViews classes now have a set of functions
named get_function_*_from_local_dof_values that return the function
values, gradients etc. from a local vector of degree-of-freedom
values. They also now contain a data structure called OutputType
that that provides the output type for the product of the value
and derivatives of basis functions of the view and any number type.
