Changed: Split TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum into base and derived class.
Added a template specialization for TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum
in case of having a VectorizedArray as arithmetic type.
In addition, TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum is now able to handle
distinct 1D matrices in each tensor dimension.
