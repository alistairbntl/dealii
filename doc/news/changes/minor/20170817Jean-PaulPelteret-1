Fixed: The following non-member functions operating on SymmetricTensors have
been generalized for all number types:
  - scalar_product()
  - double_contract()
  - invert() for rank-4 symmetric tensors
  - operator*() performing a double contraction between two symmetric tensors.
  - operator*() performing a single contraction of a symmetric tensor with a
    rank-1 tensor.
