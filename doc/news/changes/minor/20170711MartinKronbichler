New: A new class TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum that represents a tensor
product of a mass and derivative matrix has been added. It implements both the
matrix-vector operation (TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum::vmult()) as well as
the inverse operation (TensorProductMatrixSymmetricSum::apply_inverse())
operation in tensorial form with optimal complexity of
<tt>size<sup>dim+1</sup></tt> operations. The inverse operation uses the fast
diagonalization method.
