New: The ParameterHandler::parse_input() function and friends now make
a guarantee that if a parameter value does not match its pattern, or
an associated action throws an exception, that the enclosing
ParameterHandler object will be reset to the same subsection level
it was in before ParameterHandler::parse_input() was called.
