Improved: The multigrid smoothers now provide an additional apply() method that
specializes the smoothing for the case the input vector is set to zero. This
method is used in the Multigrid class and saves one matrix-vector product,
which can speed up the multigrid algorithm by up to 10 percent, depending on
the cost of the smoother.
