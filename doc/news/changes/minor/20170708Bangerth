Changed: The DoFRenumbering::compute_component_wise() function used to
take two template arguments that denote iterator types, one for the
begin and one for the end iterator. This has been changed: It now only
takes an iterator type argument for the begin iterator, and the end
iterator is automatically casted to that same type.
