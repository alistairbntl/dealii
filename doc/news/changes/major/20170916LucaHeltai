New: Added support for the Open Asset Import Library (Assimp) 
(http://assimp.sourceforge.net/). This library can be used 
to read about 40 different 3D graphics formats, used in 3D 
modelers (such as Blender, Maya, etc.). Some of these formats
contain mesh information, that in turn can be read 
into deal.II Triangulation<2,3> objects.
