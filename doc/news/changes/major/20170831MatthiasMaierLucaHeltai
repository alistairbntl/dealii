Improved: The support for non-Lagrangian elements with generalized support
points has been vastly improved. FESystem::get_generalized_support_point()
now returns a list of unique generalized support points for the finite
element system. In order to do interpolation a function
FiniteElement::convert_generalized_support_points_to_dof_values() can be
used. This interface is implement for a wide variety of base classes and
FESystem. TODO
