New: A new manifold class TransfiniteInterpolationManifold implementing an
interpolation from a curved boundary description to the interior has been
added. This class enables high-order convergence rates of more than three in
the power of the mesh size for situations where a curved manifold can only be
prescribed to the boundary but not in a whole volume.
