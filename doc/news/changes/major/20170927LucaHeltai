New: Added support for the ARKode solver of the SUNDIALS 
library. ARKode is a solver library that provides 
adaptive-step time integration of the initial value problem 
for systems of stiff, nonstiff, and multi-rate systems of 
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given in linearly 
implicit form.
