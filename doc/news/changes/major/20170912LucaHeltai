New: A new SUNDIALS::IDA class has been added that interfaces
the SUNDIALS IDA library (https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials)
This class can be used to solve differential algebraic equations
using IDA (an implicit differential algebraic equation solver, that
supports variable step and variable order BDF schemes).
